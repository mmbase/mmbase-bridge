 * A transaction is an environment that allows for the editing of nodes

 * all fail. A transaction acts as a cloud. All that can be done in a cloud can
 * be done in a transaction.
 * For example a node retrieved using the transaction's getNode method resides
 * in the transaction, if you change or remove the node, you can later roll it
 * back by calling the transaction's cancel method.
