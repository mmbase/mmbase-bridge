/**
 * This interface represents a relation constraint.  More specifically, it represents a relation manager (itself a node
 * manager) as it applies between a node belonging to two other node managers.  Some of the information here is
 * retrieved from the NodeManager used to build the catual relation node (the data as described in the xml builder
 * config file). This NodeManager is also referred to as the parent.  Other data is retrieved from a special (hidden)
 * object that decsribes what relations apply between two nodes.  (formerly known as the TypeRel builder).  This
 * includes direction and cardinality, and the NodeManagers of nodes itself. These fields cannot be changed except
 * through the use of an administration module.  This interface is therefore not a real mmbase 'object' in itself - it
 * exists of two objects joined together.
