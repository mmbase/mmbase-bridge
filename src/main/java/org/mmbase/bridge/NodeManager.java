/**
 * <p>
 * This interface represents a node's type information object. This is also commonly - because of
 * legacy -  referred to as 'builder'.</p>
 *
 * <p>It contains all the field and attribute information, as well as GUI data for editors and
 * some information on {@link #getDescendants derived} and {@link #getParent deriving} types. It also contains some maintenance code - code
 * to create new nodes, and code to query objects belonging to the same manager.</p>
 *
 * <p> Node types are normally maintained using configuration files (and not in the database), in so
 * called 'builder xmls'.</p>
 *
  <p>A NodeManager does however extend {@link Node}, because an entry for each node manager is stored
 * in the 'typedef' NodeManager. The number {@link Node#getNumber} of the NodeManager is the 'otype'
 * field of the Nodes of that type.</p>

     * <pre>
     * "number = 100" (!=, <, >, <= and >= can also be used)
     * "name = 'admin'",
     * "email IS NULL" (indicating the email field is empty)

     * "number BETWEEN 99 AND 101"
     * "name IN ('admin', 'anonymous')"
     * </pre>
     *
     * The NOT operator can be used to get the opposite result like:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "NOT (number = 100)"
     * "NOT (name = 'admin')",
     * "email IS NOT NULL"
     * "email NOT LIKE '%.org'" (indication the email should not end with .org)
     * "number NOT BETWEEN 99 AND 101"
     * "name NOT IN ('admin', 'anonymous')"
     * </pre>
     *
     * Some special functions (not part of standard SQL, but most databases
     * support them) can be used like:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "LOWER(name) = 'admin'" (to also allow 'Admin' to be selected)
     * "LENGTH(name) > 5" (to only select names longer then 5 characters)
     * </pre>
     *
     * Constraints can be linked together using AND and OR:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "((number=100) OR (name='admin') AND email LIKE '%.org')"
     * </pre>
     *
     * The single quote can be escaped using it twice for every single
     * occurrence:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "name='aaa''bbb'" (if we want to find the string aaa'bbb)
     * </pre>
