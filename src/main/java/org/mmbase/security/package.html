    <p>
      The security infrastructure of MMBase. MMBase has a pluggable security system, which is
      currently called from within the bridge implementation. The core of this setup are the
      abstract classes `Authorization' and `Authentication', which are connected with 'UserContext'
      implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several interesting security implementations available in a standard MMBase
      installation, but you can always implement your own. The implementations can be found in
      subpackages of org.mmbase.bridge.implementation.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
     The most powerful implementation is the 'context' implementation which supplies a a system of
     user, groups and 'contexts', which is configured by a sophisticated xml file.
    </li>
    <li>
     Another implementation is the 'cloud' implementation which is a simpler system with only users
     (no groups) which are stored as MMBase objects, so you can administrate this with the normal
     MMBase edit tools.
   </li>
    <li>
     There is also a 'context' implementation available which is completely in cloud. This one is
     shipped as an MMBase 'application'.
   </li>
