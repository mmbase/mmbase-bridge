    <title>org.mmbase.util.functions - The MMBase 'function framework'.</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The function framework is all about the creation of {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.Function} instances, from which
      then, subsequently, function <em>values</em> can be acquired. To do that you need to supply the
      {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.Parameters} to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions come in several different variants. There are completely stand alone functions,
      e.g. {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.Functions} (of which a limited number of instances
      can exists), but they can also be associated with some object (in OO speak: they mimic
      <em>instance member functions</em> of that object then). {@link
      org.mmbase.util.functions.NodeFunction} Function objects can e.g. be associated with {@link
      org.mmbase.bridge.Node} objects. Such function objects can exists very many (for every
      possible node, for every function on it, there can be a Function object). Other object
      instance related functions may be associated with Modules and NodeManager.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use functions</h2>
    <p>
      Taglib users would use the function tags. Those are documented in the taglib reference
      documentation (and a bit of small example code can be found in javadoc of {@link
      org.mmbase.util.functions.ExampleBuilder}). More taglib examples for functions can be found in
      /mmexamples/taglib/functions.jsp of the distro.

    <p>
      A programmer needs to know several things.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Functions are basically bridge things. So nodes are bridge Nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          FunctionProviders have {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.FunctionProvider#addFunction(Function)}
        </li>
        <li>
          {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.AbstractFunction} is available to quickly define a function. 
        </li>
        <li>
          {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.NodeFunction} is available to quickly define a function on a Node.
        </li>
        <li>
          An example of a node and builder function implementation can be found in {@link org.mmbase.util.functions.ExampleBuilder}.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also add functions to a builder in the builder XML. E.g. based on a method in another class, or other FunctionProvider.
        </li>
      </ul>
